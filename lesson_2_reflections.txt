What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git creates a file, called .git, that will track metadata about the files in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place to gather all of your changes (possibly in multiple files) together so that they can be submitted as a single commit.  Without this, you would only be able to commit a single file at a time.
